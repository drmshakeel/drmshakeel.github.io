I am currently working as a Scientist at [Honda Research Institute Japan Co., Ltd.](https://www.jp.honda-ri.com/en/members/muhammad-shakeel/), where I am conducting research in the field of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and multi-speaker ASR.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in systems and control engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Kazuhiro Nakadai](https://researchmap.jp/nakadai) in [Robotics and AI Lab](https://www.ra.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/en/), [Department of Systems and Control Engineering](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/sc/eng/faculty/research_lab/), at the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) (now Institute of Science Tokyo). During my Ph.D., my research focused on anomaly detection, classification, and multi-modal integration using deep learning-based algorithms.

I hold a strong background in Artificial Intelligence, with an M.Sc. in [Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/corso/2024/30431/home) from [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en). During my master's studies, I had the opportunity to conduct my thesis research in the field of [Search and Rescue Robotics](https://www.rm.is.tohoku.ac.jp/englishtop/) at the [Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University](https://www.is.tohoku.ac.jp/en/), Japan, under the supervision of [Prof. Satoshi Tadokoro](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=909K-EUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Daniele Nardi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xZwripcAAAAJ&hl=en) ([Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en)).

I also earned a B.Sc. in [Electronics](https://ww2.comsats.edu.pk/phy/BSEC.aspx) from [COMSATS University Islamabad](https://islamabad.comsats.edu.pk) (former COMSATS Institute of Information Technology).

Additionally, I also worked under the supervision of [Prof. Arshad Saleem Bhatti](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arshad-Bhatti-2), contributing to the development of read-out electronics for the Inner Tracking System (ITS) of the ALICE detector at [CERN](https://greybook.cern.ch/institute/detail?id=076486) â€” one of the four major [experiments](https://greybook.cern.ch/experiment/detail?id=ALICE) at CERN. My primary contribution involved optimizing the communication link between the sensor board and the first readout electronics board.
