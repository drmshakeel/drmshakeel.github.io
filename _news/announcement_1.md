:trophy: I have successfully earned my Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) in Systems and Control Engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology. This milestone marks the culmination of years of dedicated research and academic pursuit. Iâ€™m grateful for the support of my advisors, collaborators, and peers throughout this journey.
